# the PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
pdbstats
```

-   **Q1:** What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

    My pbdstats dataframe has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems.

    ```{r}
    sum(as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray, pdbstats$EM))
    ```

    We found a function called `gsub()` . I can use this to make a function that I can use for every column in the table.

    ```{r}
    commasum <- function(x) {
      sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
    }

    totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
    totals
    ```

    ```{r}
    round(totals/totals["Total"]*100, 2)
    ```

    85% were solved by x-ray and 9% by EM.

-   **Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

    ```{r}
    commasum(pdbstats["Protein (only)", "Total"])/totals["Total"]*100
    ```

    87%

-   **Q.** What fraction of Uniprot structures are represented in the PDB?

    0.09%

```{r}
215684/249751891*100
```

# visualizing protein structure

We will learn the basics of Mol\* (mol-star) homepage: <https://molstar.org/viewer/>

We will play with PDB 1HSG:

![HIV-Pr with a bound inhibitor](1HSG.png)

![with ASP25 residues represented as ball-and-stick figures](1HSG%20copy.png)

## back to R and working with PDB structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)
hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

here we will do a normal mode analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of predicted motions.

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```

Then I can open this file in Mol\*
